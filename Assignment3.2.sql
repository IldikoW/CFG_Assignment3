/*
In order to help a friend who has a dog walking business to store her clients and jobs. To do 
I have created the following tables: clients or the names, contacts  for contact details, and dogs for the dog names and breed. 
More than one owner can have more than one dog so it is a many-to-many relationship I created a table to join dogs and owners 
called dogs_owners. There is another table called jobs that contains the dog walking jobs with the date, start, and finish of the walks.
The column time is calculated with start and finish time and shows how long the walk was. The column total shows the total price of the walk = time x Â£12
